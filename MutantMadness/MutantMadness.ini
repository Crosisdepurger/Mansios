synopsys.English=You came to the park to enjoy some peace and sunshine, but instead you witness unspeakable horror.
description.English=This is my first scenario, it is quite straightforward but I tried to make something worth an hour or so of your time. There's a couple of endings based on how much evidence you find, there is a "clock" that will pop if you spend too much time before reaching a certain point, but this is not a hardcore time crunch. I hope you like it! Feedback welcome.
